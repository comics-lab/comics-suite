# org_level_Scripts â€” Conversation Snapshot

Canonical source: `org_level_Scripts/README.md`

Short summary

- Purpose: Capture the diagnosis and fixes applied to `git_pull.sh` and `git_push.sh` which exhibited a hang when iterating repositories produced by `gh repo list`.
- Key points: The hang was caused by piping `gh` output into a `while read` loop, which made the loop's stdin a pipe; commands inside the loop (e.g., `git pull`) could try to read from that pipe and block. Fix: read repo names into an array with `mapfile -t repos < <(gh repo list ...)` and iterate the array. Removed unnecessary `/dev/tty` stdin redirection; recommend configuring git credential helpers or SSH to avoid interactive prompts.

Where to find original artifacts

- Full README and transcript: `org_level_Scripts/README.md`
- Scripts: `org_level_Scripts/git_pull.sh`, `org_level_Scripts/git_push.sh`, `org_level_Scripts/grab_org.sh`

Suggested next steps

- Keep the original README in place and use this file as an indexed docs entry.
- If desired, I can move/duplicate the full transcript into `docs/conversations/` as a complete copy; confirm if you want originals relocated.
