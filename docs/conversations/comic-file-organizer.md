# comic-file-organizer â€” Conversation Snapshot

Canonical source: `comic-file-organizer/CONVERSATION.md`

Short summary

- Purpose: Preserve the full conversation and decisions made while integrating the Disk-Folder-File Analyzer (DFA) into `comic-file-organizer`.
- Key points: vendor-copy integration, scanner behavior changes (followlinks, inode/device tracking, hardlink deduplication, symlink-loop avoidance), tests added and verified (4 passed), and README_EXTRA.md provides test/run instructions.

Where to find original artifacts

- Full transcript and details: `comic-file-organizer/CONVERSATION.md`
- Integration bookmarks: `comic-file-organizer/BOOKMARKS.md`
- Additional README: `comic-file-organizer/README_EXTRA.md` (if present)

Suggested next steps

- Keep the original `CONVERSATION.md` in-place for history, but use this file as the docs portal entry for the topic.
- Optionally move or symlink the original conversation into this docs folder for consistency.
